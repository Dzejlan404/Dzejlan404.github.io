            <p>We are pleased that you are interested in our online shop. The protection of your privacy is very important to us. Below we will inform you in detail about how we handle your data.</p>
        
            <h3>1. Access Data and Hosting</h3>
            <p>You can visit our websites without providing any personal information. Every time you access a website, the web server automatically saves a so-called server log file, which contains, for example, the name of the requested file, your IP address, the date and time of access, the amount of data transferred, and the requesting provider (access data) and documents the access.</p>
        
            <h3>2. Data Collection and Use for Contract Processing</h3>
            <p>We collect personal data when you provide it to us as part of your order or when you contact us (e.g., via contact form or email). Mandatory fields are marked as such because in these cases we absolutely need the data to process the contract or to process your contact, and you cannot complete the order or send the contact without providing this information. The data collected can be seen from the respective input forms. We use the data you provide in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1.</p>
        
            <h3>3. Data Transfer</h3>
            <p>In order to fulfill the contract in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 Clause 1 Letter b of GDPR, we pass on your data to the shipping company commissioned with the delivery, insofar as this is necessary for the delivery of ordered goods. Depending on which payment service provider you select in the ordering process, we will pass on the payment data collected for this purpose to the credit institution commissioned to make the payment and, if applicable, to payment service providers commissioned by us in order to process payments.</p>
        
            <h3>4. E-mail Newsletter</h3>
            <p>If you subscribe to our newsletter, we will use the data required for this purpose or separately provided by you to regularly send you our e-mail newsletter based on your consent in accordance with Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 Letter a of GDPR. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time and can do so either by sending a message to the contact option described below or via a link provided for this purpose in the newsletter.</p>
        
            <h3>5. Cookies and Web Analysis</h3>
            <p>In order to make visiting our website attractive and to enable the use of certain functions, to display suitable products or for market research, we use so-called cookies on various pages. This serves to safeguard our legitimate interests, which predominate in the context of a balancing of interests, in an optimized presentation of our offer in accordance with Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 Letter f of GDPR. Cookies are small text files that are automatically saved on your device. Some of the cookies we use are deleted at the end of the browser session, i.e., after you close your browser (so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain.</p>
        
            <h4>Use of Google (Universal) Analytics for Web Analysis</h4>
            <p>If you have given your consent in accordance with Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 Letter a of GDPR, this website uses Google (Universal) Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google LLC (www.google.de), for the purpose of website analysis. Google (Universal) Analytics uses methods that enable an analysis of your use of the website, such as cookies. The automatically collected information about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA.</p>
        
            <h3>6. Online Marketing</h3>
            <h4>Google AdSense</h4>
            <p>Our website markets space for third-party and advertising network ads via Google AdSense. These ads are displayed to you at various points on this website. If you have given us your consent in accordance with Art. 6 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 Letter a of GDPR, the so-called DoubleClick cookie will be set by Google as part of the integration of Google AdSense. This enables the display of interest-based advertising by automatically assigning a pseudonymous user ID, with the help of which the interests are determined based on visits to this website.</p>
